# Programacion4_Project
C++ Object-Oriented Programming semester project – Udelar

This repository contains the semester-long project for the Programming 4 course at Universidad de la República (Udelar, 2022).

The project involves implementing object-oriented systems in C++, applying the concepts learned in the course: analysis, design, and implementation using object-oriented principles, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, object collections, and operator overloading. The work was carried out in 5 lab submissions, reflecting the evolution of the project throughout the semester.
